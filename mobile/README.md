# Castle Mobile

People are on their phones a lot. Now Castle will be too.

## Run

For best results make sure your computer and phone are on the same local area network.

### Common

Make sure you have [Expo](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/introduction/installation). ðŸ‘€

In 'mobile/':

- `npm i`
- `expo r --lan` (or `expo r --tunnel` if your computer and phone aren't on the same local area network).

Keep this running. It will show logs.

### iOS

Do 'Common' above first (it will write a file telling the iOS code how to load the JavaScript from your computer).

Make sure you have Xcode. Open the file ending in '.xcworkspace' under 'ios/'. Then hit Cmd + R.
