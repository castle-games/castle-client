The version of cmake in the Docker image uses a version of curl that doesn't support https.
Tried following https://github.com/ruslo/hunter/issues/328#issuecomment-198672048 but ran into an issue compiling curl, so we just copy the files it needs into the build directory so it doesn't have to download them.
