```

## Code Style

- Run `format.sh` after making changes to native code.
- For JS code in the desktop UI, see [desktop/README.md](desktop/README.md).

## Run on macOS

See [macosx/README.md](macosx/README.md).

## Run on mobile

See [mobile/README.md](mobile/README.md).

## Run on Windows

### Prereqs

- Install https://gitforwindows.org/. *Use this program to clone the repo, not WSL.*
- Install CMake. https://cmake.org/download/
  - Make sure to check the "add to PATH for current user" option.
- Install Visual Studio 2017. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs
  - When you are prompted to install some "Workloads", at the minimum you want "Desktop development with C++". You can come back to this screen later if you want more things.

### Build and run

Use either Git Bash or WSL to run commands in.

- Make sure Git LFS is initialized.
- Go into the 'megasource/' directory.
- Run `sh configure_cmake.sh`. You don't need to do this every time, but you need to do it at least on the first build.
- Run `cmake.exe --build build --config Debug`. If the build succeeds but is unable to write 'Castle.exe', make sure any existing Castle processes are terminated and try again. On WSL, `sh kill_castle.sh` under 'megasource/' works for terminating Castle processes.
- Run `./build/Debug/Castle.exe` to launch the Castle binary that was built.

## Run on Linux

- You will need the following library dependencies, however they are distributed
  in your distribution of Linux: SDL2, libGLU, openal, luajit, libdevil,
  freetype, physfs, libmodplug, mpg123, libogg, libvorbis, libtheora, openssl.
- You will also need CMake and the usual gcc commands.
- In the 'love/' directory, run `cmake -H. -Bbuild`.
- Then go into the 'build/' directory that created, and run `make` (tip: add
  `-j5` as an argument to use more CPU and less time).
- This results in a 'love' binary in that directory.
- Now from the 'base/' directory at the root of your checkout of this
  repository, run `../love/build/love .`.
